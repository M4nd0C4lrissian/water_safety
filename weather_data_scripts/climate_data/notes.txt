Toronto city has dense hourly and daily data.

Toronto Pearson International airport is only consistently monitored from 2013 onward.

Buttonville is split into three IDs - 4841, 54239, and 53678 - need to be combined. Haven't checked yet, but it seems to have everything - just needs piecing we will see.

The afforementioned two have both daily and hourly data.

North York and East York Dustan have only daily, and East Dustan has many large gaps - maybe we want to avoid using it (and maybe we should focus prediction on Hanlan's point?)
